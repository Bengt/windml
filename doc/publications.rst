Support Vector Machines for Wind Energy Prediction in Smart Grids, 2013
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Oliver Kramer, Nils Andr√© Treiber, Fabian Gieseke

In recent years, there has been a significant increase in energy
produced by sustainable resources like wind- and solar power plants.
This led to a shift from traditional energy systems to so-called smart
grids (i.e., distributed systems of energy suppliers and consumers).
While the sustainable energy resources are very appealing from an
environmental point of view, their volatileness renders the integration
into the overall energy system difficult. For this reason, short-term
wind and solar energy prediction systems are essential for balance
authorities to schedule spinning reserves and reserve energy. In this
chapter, we build upon our previous work and provide a detailed
practical analysis of several wind energy learning scenarios. Our
approach makes use of support vector regression models, one of the
state-of-the art techniques in the field of machine learning, to build
effective predictors for single wind turbines based on data given for
neighbored turbines.

Wind energy prediction and monitoring with neural computation, 2013
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Oliver Kramer, Fabian Gieseke, Benjamin Satzger

Wind energy has an important part to play as renewable energy resource in a
sustainable world. For a reliable integration of wind energy high-dimensional
wind time-series have to be analyzed. Fault analysis and prediction are an
important aspect in this context. The objective of this work is to show how
methods from neural computation can serve as forecasting and monitoring
techniques, contributing to a successful integration of wind into sustainable
and smart energy grids. We will employ support vector regression as prediction
method for wind energy time-series. Furthermore, we will use dimension
reduction techniques like self-organizing maps for monitoring of
high-dimensional wind time-series. The methods are briefly introduced, related
work is presented, and experimental case studies are exemplarily described. The
experimental parts are based on real wind energy time-series data from the
National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) western wind resource data set.

Analysis of Wind Energy Time Series with Kernel Methods and Neural Networks, 2011
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Oliver Kramer, Fabian Gieseke

Wind energy has an important part to play as renewable energy resource in a
sustainable world. For a reliable integration of wind energy the volatile
nature of wind has to be understood. This article shows how kernel methods and
neural networks can serve as modeling, forecasting and monitoring techniques,
and, how they contribute to a successful integration of wind into smart energy
grids. First, we will employ kernel density estimation for modeling of wind
data. Kernel density estimation allows a statistically sound modeling of time
series data. The corresponding experiments are based on real data of wind
energy time series from the NREL western wind resource dataset. Second, we will
show how prediction of wind energy can be accomplished with the help of support
vector regression. Last, we will use self-organizing feature maps to map
high-dimensional wind time series to colored sequences that can be used for
error detection.

Short-Term Wind Energy Forecasting Using Support Vector Regression, 2010
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Abstract Wind energy prediction has an important part to play in a smart energy
grid for load balancing and capacity planning. In this paper we explore, if
wind measurements based on the existing infrastructure of windmills in
neighbored wind parks can be learned with a soft computing approach for wind
energy prediction in the ten-minute to six-hour range. For this sake we employ
Support Vector Regression (SVR) for time series forecasting, and run
experimental analyses on real-world wind data from the NREL western wind
resource dataset. In the experimental part of the paper we concentrate on loss
function parameterization of SVR. We try to answer how far ahead a reliable
wind forecast is possible, and how much information from the past is necessary.
We demonstrate the capabilities of SVR-based wind energy forecast on the
micro-scale level of one wind grid point, and on the larger scale of a whole
wind park.
